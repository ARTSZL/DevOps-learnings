# Web app setup with AWS cloud [Lift&Shift]

## Flow of execution
- Login to AWS Account
- Create Key Pairs
- Create Security Groups
- Launch Instances with user data
- Update IP to name mapping in Route53
- Build Application from source code
- Upload to S3 Bucket
- Download Artifact to Tomcat EC2 Instance
- Setup ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) with HTTPS
- Map ELB Endpoint to website name
- Verify
- Build Autoscaling Group for Tomcat Instances

## Steps
- In AWS console go to EC2
- Choose the region
- On left side find Key Pairs in Network & Security
- Create Key Pair using the orange button on the right top 'Create key pair'
- Add some short but descriptive name, choose the private key type and format, you can also add some tags
- After created the key pair go to security group
- Create Security Group using the orange button on the right top 'Create security group'
  - Security group for Load Balancer with inbound rule:
    - HTTPS, port: **443**, source: **Anywhere**
  - Security group for Tomcat instance with inbound rules:
    - Custom TCP, port: **8080**, source: **security group of the Load Balancer**
    - Custom TCP, port: **22**, source: **My IP** (for SSH to instances)
    - Custom TCP, port: **8080**, source: **My IP** (for acces directly from browser rather than from the Load Balancer)
  - Security group for backend services with inbound rules:
    - MySQL, port: **3306**, source: **application security group** (for database)
    - Custom TCP, port: **11211**, source: **application security group** (for memcache)
    - Custom TCP, port: **5672**, source: **application security group** (for RabbitMQ)
    - All traffic, port: **All**, source: **backend security group** (allow internal traffic to flow on all ports)
    - Custom TCP, port: **22**, source: **My IP** (for SSH to instances)
- Clone the repository https://github.com/hkhcoder/vprofile-project/tree/aws-LiftAndShift
- Go to EC2 Instances and launch the instances
  - Name: **db01**, AMI: **CentOS Streame 9**, instance type: **t3.micro**, key pair: **created earlier**, firewall: **backend security group**, in advanced details copy and paste the mysql.sh entire script
  - Name: **mc01**, AMI: **CentOS Streame 9**, instance type: **t3.micro**, key pair: **created earlier**, firewall: **backend security group**, in advanced details copy and paste the memcache.sh entire script
  - Name: **rmq01**, AMI: **CentOS Streame 9**, instance type: **t3.micro**, key pair: **created earlier**, firewall: **backend security group**, in advanced details copy and paste the rabbitmq.sh entire script
  - Name: **app01**, AMI: **Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS**, instance type: **t3.micro**, key pair: **created earlier**, firewall: **application security group**, in advanced details copy and paste the tomcat_ubuntu.sh entire script
- To verify the services you can SSH to them using key pair and user name and IP
  - ssh -i [key pair directory] ec2-user@[db public IP address]
  - ssh -i [key pair directory] ec2-user@[memcache public IP address]
  - ssh -i [key pair directory] ec2-user@[RabbitMQ public IP address]
  - ssh -i [key pair directory] ubuntu@[application public IP address]
- Go to Route53 to create hosted zone in type Private and use the same region as instances
- After that create the record with Simply Routing
- Definy simple record
  - db01.[hosted zone name] with private IP of db01 instance
